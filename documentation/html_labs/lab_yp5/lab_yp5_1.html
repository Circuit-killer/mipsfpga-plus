<p><big><b>1.  Introduction</b></big></p>

<p>This lab demostrates how a student can directly observe the work of
pipeline forwarding, one of the most important microarchitectural tricks in
CPU design.  During the lab, a student connects the bypass control signals
in MIPSfpga CPU core to the LED signals on FPGA board and watches with his
eyes the pattern of flashing LEDs when running different assembly programs
on a synthesized MIPSfpga system configured inside the FPGA.  Obviously, in
order to see anything meaningful with this way of observation, the design
uses a really slow clock, a dozen of beats per second or less.</p>

<p>The method used in this lab is not a substitute for traditional debug,
trace and performance measuring methods used to evaluate microarchitectural
features by experienced CPU designers.  This lab is intended for a beginning
student who wants to visualize the work of a pipeline in the most
straightforward fashion, without using too much imagination.  The subsequent
labs in MIPSfpga 2.0 package use more complicated and more generally
applicable methods to explore the processor pipelining, one of the most
important topics for any student of computer architecture and electronic
design.</p>
