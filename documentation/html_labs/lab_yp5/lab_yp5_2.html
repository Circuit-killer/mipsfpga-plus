<p>The pipelining is a technique to improve the throughput of a digital
design by splitting the data processing into stages and moving the items to
be processed through those stages, starting new items before finishing old
items.  The process works just like a pipeline in a car factory: while each
individual car takes long time to assemble, the pipeline as a whole produces
a new car every few minutes.</p>

<p><b><font color=blue>Figure 1</font></b> shows an application of
pipelining to the CPU design, using as an example the classic five-stage
pipeline used in early implementations of MIPS architecture back in 1980s. 
The items to be processed are CPU instructions, and the stages include:
fetching the instruction from the instruction memory; decoding the
instruction; reading the values of the applicable registers (visible to the
software, so-called <i>architecture registers</i>); performing arithmetic
and data memory operations; and finally, writing the results back to the
architecture register file:</p>

pipelining from the slides that accompany book <i>Digital Design and
