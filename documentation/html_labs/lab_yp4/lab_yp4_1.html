<p><big><b>1.  Introduction</b></big></p>

<p>This lab demonstrates how the work of CPU cache can be observed in the
most obvious and straigtforward fashion when running MIPSfpga-based system
on FPGA board.  During this lab a student makes the design clock running
really slow (a dozen of beats per second), and then the student's program
fills a two-dimentional memory array in one of two different ways: either
moving row index first or moving column index first.</p>

<p>Since each cache line in MIPSfpga CPU cache holds four 32-bit words, the
generated pattern of cache misses is going to be different in those two
runs.  When the program fills the memory array by moving column index first,
the pattern is going to be "cache miss - hit - hit - hit - miss - hit - hit
- hit - miss ...", but when the program fills the array by moving raw index
first, the pattern is going to be a series of cache misses followed by a
long series of cache hits, since a large portion of the array is already in
the cache.</p>

<p>This hit and miss pattern is going to be directly observable using a
signal that indicates cache line fill request.  This signal is going to be
connected to an LED on FPGA board.  When running the design with very slow
clock, the blinking of this signal is directly observed, making the work of
cache immediately obvious for even the most beginning student.</p>

<p>This lab does not attempts to measure, quatify or analyze cache behaviour
in details.  It's only goal is to create "A-ha" moment for a person who
needs to visualize fo himself the role a CPU cache plays in the computer
system.</p>
