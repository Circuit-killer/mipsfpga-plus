<p><big><b>3.  Lab steps</b></big></p>

<p>This section outlines the sequence of steps, necessary to complete the
lab.  Almost all generic steps in this lab are the same as in <i>MIPSfpga
2.0 Lab YP1.  Using MIPSfpga with Serial Loader Flow that does not require
BusBlaster board and OpenOCD software</i>.  Such generic steps are not
described in this section.  Only the steps different from <i>Lab YP1</i> are
explained in details.</p>

<p><big><b>3.1.  Connect the board to the computer</b></big></p>

<p>For <i>Digilent</i> boards, such as <i>Nexys4</i>, <i>Nexys4 DDR</i> or
<i>Basys3</i>, this step is obvious.  For <i>Altera/Terasic</i> boards some
additional steps required:</p>

<ol>

<li>Connect USB-to-UART connector to FPGA board. 
Either <i>FT232RL</i> or <i>PL2303TA</i> that you can by from AliExpress or
RadioShack will do the job.  <i>TX</i> output from the connector (green wire
on <i>PL2303TA</i>) should go to pin 3 from right bottom on Terasic DE0,
DE0-CV, DE1, DE2-115 (right top on DE0-Nano) and <i>GND</i> output (black
wire on <i>PL2303TA</i>) should be connected to pin 6 from right bottom on
Terasic DE0, DE0-CV, DE1, DE2-115 (right top on DE0-Nano).  Please consult
photo picture in <i>Lab YP1</i> to avoid short-circuit or other connection
problems.</li> </ol>

<li>For <i>FT232RL</i> connector: make sure to set 3.3V/5V jumper on
<i>FT232RL</i> part to 3.3V.</li>

<li>For the boards that require external power in addition to the power that
comes from USB, connect the power supply.  The boards that require the extra
power supply include <i>Terasic DE2-115</i>.</li>

<li>Connect FPGA board to the computer using main connection cable provided
by the board manufacturers.  Make sure to put USB cable to the right jack
when ambiguity exists (such as in <i>Terasic DE2-115</i> board).</li>

<li>Make sure to power the FPGA board (turn on the power switch) before
connecting the UART cable from USB-to-UART connector to the computer. 
Failing to do so may result in electric damage to the board.</li>

<li>Connect USB-to-UART connector to FPGA board.</li>

</ol>

<p><big><b>3.2.  Select the appropriate hardware system configuration for
the lab</b></big></p>

<p>Before running synthesis it is necessary to review and possibly modify
the file <i>system_rtl/mfp_ahb_lite_matrix_config.vh</i> that includes a set
of Verilog <i>`define</i> statements that determine the functionality of the
synthesized MIPSfpga system.  The configuration should be the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>File <i>system_rtl/mfp_ahb_lite_matrix_config.vh</i></p>
<pre>

//
//  Configuration parameters
//

// `define MFP_USE_WORD_MEMORY
// `define MFP_INITIALIZE_MEMORY_FROM_TXT_FILE
   `define MFP_USE_SLOW_CLOCK_AND_CLOCK_MUX
   `define MFP_USE_UART_PROGRAM_LOADER
// `define MFP_DEMO_LIGHT_SENSOR
   `define MFP_DEMO_CACHE_MISSES
// `define MFP_DEMO_PIPE_BYPASS

</pre></blockquote>

<p><big><b>3.3.  Run the synthesis and configure the FPGA with the synthesized MIPSfpga system</b></big></p>

<p>This step is identical to the synthesis step in <i>Lab YP1</i></p>

<p><big><b>3.4.  Go to the lab directory and clean it up</b></big></p>

<p>Under Windows:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
cd programs\lab_yp4
00_clean_all.bat
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Under Linux:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
cd programs/lab_yp4
00_clean_all.sh
</pre></blockquote>

<p><big><b>3.5.  Review the lab program code</b></big></p>

<p>The main program is located in file <i>programs/lab_yp4/main.c</i>.</p>

<p>The loop at the beginning (<i>"while ((MFP_SWITCHES & 4) == 0) ;"</i>) is
needed so that the program can start with high clock speed (25 MHz) and the
switch to very low clock speed (12.5 Hz) happens only after you first switch
the speed by turning on switch one and then let the program to continue by
turning on switch two.</p>

<p>The program has two variants - with uncommented <i>"a [i][j] = i +
j;"</i> and with uncommented <i>"a [j][i] = i + j;"</i>.  For the first run
make sure <i>"a [i][j] = i + j;"</i> is uncommented and <i>"a [j][i] = i +
j;"</i> is commendted:</p>

<p><big><b>3.6. The first run</b></big></p>

<p>Following the procedure described in <i>Lab YP1</i>, compile and link the
program, generate Motorola S-Record file and upload this file into the
memory of the synthesized MIPSfpga-based system on the board.</p>

<p>Under Windows:</p>

<ol>

<li>cd programs\lab_yp4</li>

<li>run 02_compile_and_link.bat</li>

<li>run 08_generate_motorola_s_record_file.bat</li>

<li>run 11_check_which_com_port_is_used.bat</li>

<li>edit 12_upload_to_the_board_using_uart.bat based on the result from the
previous step - set the working port in “set a=” assignment</li>

<li>run 12_upload_to_the_board_using_uart.bat</li>

</ol>

<p>Under Linux:</p>

<ol>

<li>cd programs/lab_yp4</li>

<li>run ./02_compile_and_link.sh</li>

<li>run ./08_generate_motorola_s_record_file.sh</li>

<li>run ./11_check_which_com_port_is_used.sh</li>

<li>edit ./12_upload_to_the_board_using_uart.sh based on the result from the
previous step - set the working port in “set a=” assignment</li>

<li>./run 12_upload_to_the_board_using_uart.sh</li>

5.2. An example of student experiment: switchable clock enables to directly observe CPU cache in action

Switchable clock allows to show the internals of the processor to the students live. Here is an example: a signal that indicates cache eviction is connected to an external LED. Now it is possible to observe cache misses when a program fills a two-dimensional array. This example can be run twice: when the array is filled by columns and when the array is filled by rows. These runs generate different patters of LED blinking.

Specifically, since cache line of MIPS microAptiv UP has size of four words, the following pattern appear when filling the array column after column: miss hit hit hit miss hit hit hit ... When the array is filled row by row, the observed pattern is different: miss miss miss ... 8 times ... miss hit hit hit ... 24 times ...

To run the demonstration program below, a user has to start with fast clock, go through the initialization sequence with switch 2 off, then switch the clock from 25 MHz to 12 Hz, turn switch 2 on and observe the pattern. After that a user has to modify the program, compile and load it to the board, and run the whole thing again.

Note that such demos are very sensitive to compiler optimizations, so the code should be kept simple and straightforward, otherwise the compiler moves actions around and the pattern becomes unclear. Also note that the first ~3 cache misses likely result from instruction fetches filling L1 instruction cache, not L1 data cache:
